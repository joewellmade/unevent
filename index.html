        <h2>About the Bush</h2>
        <h4>Over 40 years ago the Bush Theatre began life above a pub in West London.  From the beginning the Bush has been a ground-breaking new writing theatre, championing world-class new work from voices that see the world from a different point of view. The Bush has always been at the forefront of discovering new talent. It has launched the careers of some of the best writers in the UK and has sustained an international reputation.</h4>

        <h4>In 2011, the Bush Theatre found a much-needed new home in the beautiful old Shepherd’s Bush Library. The Old Library has proved the perfect place to continue the Bush’s mission of making theatre that reflects the world around it, but this remarkable Victorian building needs urgent work to ensure the Bush can continue to grow.</h4>

        <h2>The Project</h2>
        <h4>In 2016 we will carry out a landmark redevelopment- unlocking the potential of this remarkable building and providing audiences, artists and our local community with a 21st Century theatre. During its transformation, the Bush will burst out of the Old Library and present a programme of work in iconic and rediscovered spaces in West London.</h4>

        <h3>Open to all,<br />
        accessible to all</h3>
        <p>We are inspired by the communities that surround us, and we want a theatre that reflects this. A new street level entrance and glass corridor opening on the west side of the building will ensure our building flows from foyer to street.</p>

        <p>We’ll also be making our building fully accessible for everyone, with new platform lift connecting all floors and wheelchair ramp leading right into the foyer.</p>

      <div class="large-3 columns">
        <h3>The voices of tomorrow<br />
        &nbsp;</h3>
        <p>Key to the redevelopment is a new Studio theatre – which will form a pivotal part of the Bush’s artistic vision. It will be a new home for emerging artists – embedding a generation of writers, performers and creative talent into the fabric of the building.</p>

      <div class="large-3 columns">
        <h3>More and better<br />
        &nbsp;</h3>
        <p>Our audiences love the Bush Theatre for its intimacy – and we won’t be changing this. But we will be making the experience more comfortable, and increasing capacity of our theatre by up to 20%.</p>

        <p>We’ll also have a redeveloped rehearsal room facility and dedicated technical workshop. Alongside the new Studio – these new and improved spaces mean we’ll be able to work with even more artists and welcome more people to enjoy our work and take part in our Community programme.</p>

        <h3>Projecting history,<br />
          and the planet</h3>
          <p>We love the Old Library, and are proud to be guardians of this Shepherd’s Bush landmark. We will be carrying out urgent repairs and maintenance to this historic building, alongside green cleaning and restoration work. We’ll also be carrying out a programme of works to make our building greener and more sustainable – including new glazing and a “living” roof.</p>
