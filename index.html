        <h1>Help us to write the next Act of the Bush’s history…</h1><br />
        <p>Over 40 years ago the Bush Theatre began life above a pub in West London.  From the beginning the Bush has been a ground-breaking new writing theatre, championing world-class new work from voices that see the world from a different point of view. The Bush has always been at the forefront of discovering new talent. It has launched the careers of some of the best writers in the UK and has sustained an international reputation.</p>

        <p>In 2011, the Bush Theatre found a much-needed new home in the beautiful old Shepherd’s Bush Library. The Old Library has proved the perfect place to continue the Bush’s mission of making theatre that reflects the world around it, but this remarkable Victorian building needs urgent work to ensure the Bush can continue to grow.</p>

        <h1>The Project</h1>
        <p>In 2016 we will carry out a landmark redevelopment- unlocking the potential of this remarkable building and providing audiences, artists and our local community with a 21st Century theatre. During its transformation, the Bush will burst out of the Old Library and present a programme of work in iconic and rediscovered spaces in West London.</p>

        <p class="small">We are inspired by the communities that surround us, and we want a theatre that reflects this. A new street level entrance and glass corridor opening on the west side of the building will ensure our building flows from foyer to street.</p>

        <p class="small">We’ll also be making our building fully accessible for everyone, with new platform lift connecting all floors and wheelchair ramp leading right into the foyer.</p>
